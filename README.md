# LSTM_Pipeline

The pipeline is ran in the order:

1.Tagging-PreProcessing.ipynb

2.Tagging Model.ipynb

3.FuncLoc Prediction.ipynb


To change to ELMo embeddings, run the Keras_Elmo file instead

******

2.Tagging Model adapts the model found at https://allennlp.org/tutorials

Keras_Elmo adapts the model found at https://github.com/nxs5899/Named-Entity-Recognition_DeepLearning-keras

Yiyang Gaos' code can be found at https://github.com/gyy150/Thesis_PipeLine_2. The output of the NLP pipeline as well as the raw maintenance work order data will need to be obtained separately.
