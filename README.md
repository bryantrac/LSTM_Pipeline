# LSTM_Pipeline

The pipeline is ran in the order:
1.Tagging-PreProcessing.ipynb
2.Tagging Model.ipynb
3.FuncLoc Prediction.ipynb

To change to ELMo embeddings, run the Keras_Elmo file instead


2.Tagging Model.ipynb adapts the model found at https://allennlp.org/tutorials

Keras_Elmo adapts the model found at https://github.com/nxs5899/Named-Entity-Recognition_DeepLearning-keras
